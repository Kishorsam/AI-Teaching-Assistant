# Calculus Training Data Generator and Loader

This project is designed to create, store, and load calculus-related training data for educational or machine learning purposes. It generates sample data (e.g., calculus problems and their solutions) in JSON Lines format, handles file-related errors, and provides easy-to-use tools for processing the data.

---

## Features
- **Training Data Generation**: Automatically generates calculus problems (e.g., derivatives of polynomials) with answers.
- **Data Storage**: Stores the generated problems and solutions in a JSON Lines file (`.jsonl`) for compatibility with machine learning workflows.
- **File Handling**: Gracefully handles missing file errors and supports both relative and absolute file paths.
- **Extensibility**: Easily customizable to generate more complex calculus problems or integrate with other systems.
